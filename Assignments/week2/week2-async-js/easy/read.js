// Write code to read contents of a file and print it to the console. 
// You can use the fs library to as a black box, the goal is to understand async tasks. 
// Try to do an expensive operation below the file read and see how it affects the output.
//  Make the expensive operation more and more expensive and see how it affects the output.

//
//when file is asynchronous it expect a callback function as third argument.
//expensive means which takes a lot of time to do any task.

// ðŸŽ¯ Final Conclusion:
// When the main thread (the call stack) is busy with an expensive (CPU-heavy) synchronous task, 
// even if an asynchronous operation like fs.readFile() has finished and its callback is sitting in the callback queue, 
// it cannot be executed until the main thread is free.
